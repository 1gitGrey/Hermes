Hermes
======

Hermes is an environment for Ruby and JavaScript developers in Darwin using tmux, Vim and iTerm 2 that focuses on speed and ease of use.

Hermes is opinionated where having an opinion is important, but does not prevent you from customizing your tools.

Hermes gives you a lot of things for free:

- Sensible defaults for developers.
- Integration of Vim into tmux and tmux into iTerm 2.
- Mouse and window integration, allowing selections within tmux panes, not across them.
- Vim packages that provide git integration, command- and block-completion, fuzzy file search and ease of testing.
