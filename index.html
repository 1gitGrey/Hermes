        <h1>Hermes</h1>

<p>Hermes is an environment for Ruby and JavaScript developers in Darwin using <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">Tmux</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm 2</a> that focuses on speed and ease of use.</p>

<p>Hermes is opinionated where having an opinion is important, but does not prevent you from customizing your tools.</p>

<p>Hermes gives you a lot of things for free:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sensible defaults for developers.</li>
<li>Integration of Vim into tmux and tmux into iTerm 2.</li>
<li>Mouse and window integration, allowing selections within tmux panes, not across them.</li>
<li>Vim packages that provide git integration, command- and block-completion, fuzzy file search and ease of testing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>As first step, you should fork the project, as this will make it easier to customize your installation. After you're done, you can run:</p>

<pre><code>curl https://raw.github.com/&lt;your username&gt;/Hermes/master/go.bash | bash
</code></pre>

<p>This will perform the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check that you have all the needed Homebrew dependencies</li>
<li>Backup any file or folder that would be overwritten by the installer process</li>
<li>Install all dotfiles and plugins available in the <code>hermes</code> directory and symlink them to the right locations in your home folder</li>
</ul><p>You may also want to add Hermes's repository as upstream, so you can pull in the changes done on the main trunk whenever you need.</p>

<h2>How it's built</h2>

<p>The purpose of Hermes is to lay down a good structure where you can build upon, without adding extra configuration layers on top. For example, all of Vim's configuration is managed through the <code>~/.vimrc</code> file and the <code>~/.vim</code> folder, so that you don't have any surprises. The only big difference is that under the hood, those files are actually symlkins to your <code>hermes</code> folder.</p>

<p>To customise Hermes, it's important to understand how all of its pieces are tied together.</p>

<h3>Vim</h3>

<p>A stock vim installation with a basic configuration can go a long way and can be really beneficial when it comes to editing files on a server.</p>

<p>There is however a very simple problem with the default Vim installation that OsX provides: it cannot access the system clipboard, so if you copy anything from outside the editor, it's not available inside Vim's registers. Worse than that, if you copy anything in Vim (using its internal commands) is not shared with the rest of the system.</p>

<p>To sort this out, Hermes installed Homebrew's version of Vim, which can be made available through MacVim.</p>

<pre><code>brew install macvim --override-system-vim
</code></pre>

<p>This has some additional benefits, like having support for Ruby in plugins.</p>

<p>Let's now go with some defaults for a basic <code>.vimrc</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>set nocompatible    "don't need Vi compatibility
set nobackup        "don't create backup files
set nowritebackup
set notimeout
set ttimeout
set ttimeoutlen=10
set noswapfile      "don't create swap files
set history=50      "keep a small history
set ruler           "always show position
set showcmd
set incsearch
set laststatus=2    "full status bar
set t_Co=256        "256 colors - requires a properly configured terminal emulator
syntax on           "turn syntax highlight on

filetype plugin indent on "let plugins manage indentation

" Send more characters for redraws
set ttyfast
" Enable mouse use in all modes
set mouse=a
set ttymouse=xterm2

" Fix backspace
set backspace=indent,eol,start
fixdel

" Softtabs, 2 spaces
set tabstop=2
set shiftwidth=2
set expandtab

" Display extra whitespace at the end of the line
set list listchars=tab:»·,trail:·
" Clipboard fix for OsX
set clipboard=unnamed

" Numbers
set number
set numberwidth=2

"Folding
set foldmethod=indent
set foldlevelstart=99

" Autocompletion options
set wildmode=list:longest,list:full
set complete=.,w,b"
</code></pre>

<p>These settings will let you efficiently edit any file whose type is supported by default, and that already covers javascript and ruby.</p>
